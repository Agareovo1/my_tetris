## Task
the task is to create a Tetris Implementation, 

## Description
This is a simple Tetris game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you

to play the classic Tetris game by moving and rotating tetrominoes to fill and clear rows within a grid.

## Installation
To run the Tetris game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. follow the controls to play

## Usage
1. When the game is loaded, you will see a grid on the left side and a preview grid on the right side.
2. The grid is where the tetrominoes will fall, and your goal is to fill and clear rows to score points.
3. The preview grid shows the next tetromino that will appear.
4. Use the following controls to play the game:
    Left arrow key: Move the tetromino left.
    Right arrow key: Move the tetromino right.
    Down arrow key: Move the tetromino down faster.
    Up arrow key: Rotate the tetromino.
    Start/Pause button: Clicking this button starts or pauses the game.
5. As the game progresses, the tetrominoes will fall faster. Try to score as many points as possible before the grid fills up and the game ends.
6. The game keeps track of your score, which is displayed at the top of the page.
    Enjoy playing Tetris!
